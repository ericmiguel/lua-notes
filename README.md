# Lua Notes

My notes on learning Lua. 100% for fun.

Lua is an open source language built on top of C programming language. Lua has its value across multiple platforms ranging from large server systems to small mobile applications. Lua if often used as an embedded programming language.

One of the most interesting aspect of Lua for me is that, even being a dynamical language, it can be compiled to machine code using [LuaJIT](https://luajit.org).
